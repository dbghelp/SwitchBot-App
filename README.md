# SwitchBot Desktop App

There is currently no official desktop app for SwitchBot, so I’ve created one.

This application uses the **mobile API** (instead of the limited Open API available on GitHub), allowing it to support more features and eventually match the functionality of the official mobile app.

### Multi-Device Setup

To access the app from multiple devices, set the following environment variable in `/client/.env`:

```

Replace `<your-server-ip>` with the actual IP address of the server hosting the backend.
